# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.



### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

# Tailwind 
for styling the components I have used tailwind utility  classes . It lets you create custom user interfaces by combining utility classes to control layout, color, spacing, typography, and more. 
# redux toolkit 
 for state management I have used redux toolkit library

# feedback
I didn't face any such difficulties but if I had more time I would like to create cart page also where user can see their cart items an make final order
